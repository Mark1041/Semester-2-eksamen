                    Discoveries have been made in the Round Tower. Institutions have started here.
                    Important historical figures have come here.
                    And people from all walks of life have passed each other in search of Copenhagen’s most charming
                    view
                    34.8 metres above the street.
                    The whole world is passing through the Round Tower and has done so since 1642, when the tower was
                    finished.
                    <br> <br>
                    A historical place that also houses exhibitions, concerts and activities for young and old.
                    With its distinctive Spiral Ramp, the Round Tower is one of Denmark’s best-known and most visited
                    structures. It was built as a platform for the university observatory and for centuries it was the
                    centre of Danish astronomy. The foundation stone was laid on 7/7-1637 and five years later the Round
                    Tower was finished as the first part of the Trinity Complex, which was designed to accommodate three
                    things: the Observatory at the top of the tower, the University Library above the Trinity Church and
                    the
                    church itself below.
                    <br> <br>
                    The Round Tower is built by King Christian IV, who constructed its round walls in the royal colours
                    yellow and red. The king himself also sketched the famous golden rebus on the front of the tower:
                    Lead,
                    God, the right yeachings and jusitce into the heart of King Christian IV.
                    <br> <br>
                    Halfway up the tower you will find the Library Hall, Which has been a venue for exhibitions,
                    concerts
                    and cultural events since its reopening in 1987.
                    The platform on top of the tower has a great 360-degree city view centred by the Observatory, which
                    is
                    still used in the winter months and its thus the oldest functioning observatory in Europe.

                    The Marble Church is a church in the parish of Frederik, with the original name The Frederikâ€™s
                    Church. It is located in Frederiksstaden in the capital of Denmark, Copenhagen. The church was drawn
                    and built in the year of 1740 by the court building contractor, Nicolai Eigtved, under the reign of
                    Frederik V. In the years from 1750-1754 there were made multiple drawings of which the Church
                    Building Commision was not pleased with.

                    Since 1748 The Royal Danish Theater has been located at Kongens Nytorv in Copenhagen. For the first
                    couple of seasons the staff was very modest, it only consisted of 8 actors, 4 actresses, 2 male
                    dancers and 1 female dancer. The first expansion was The Royal Chapel that became the set inhouse
                    orchestra in 1770.
                    Around the year of 1800 the acting staff was doubled, about 30 singers formed the Oprah choir and
                    the number of dancers was ten-doubled.

                <p>
                    Ever since the age of 1600 Nyhavn has been attracting people from all over the world to the capital
                    of Denmark, Copenhagen. Nyhavn is a waterfront in Copenhagen, which, in the beginning, was used as
                    an occupation harbor for international business, but it quickly became a shelter for sailors that
                    needed girls, parties and great food. Of which you can still find in Nyhavn today. The oldest house
                    at Nyhavn has not changed since 1681 and the sidewalk in front of the house still consists of bald
                    and lumpy tiles from the very beginning of Nyhavn.

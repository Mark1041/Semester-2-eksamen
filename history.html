                <p>
                    In the 1750’s the architect Nikolaj Eigtved drew one of the main works of Danish building art,
                    Amalienborg. A statue of the founder of Frederiksstaden, Frederik V, is located in the middle of the
                    castle square, which is surrounded by four almost identical mansions. The mansions were originally
                    built for living by the four dignitary Lords, but in the year of 1794 Christiansborg Castle burned
                    down and the Royal Family moved into Amalienborg. Ever since then the regents have lived at the
                    different mansions of Amalienborg. <br>

                <p>
                    Made by Edward Eriksen in 1913. The little mermaid was a gift to Copenhagen municipality by Carl
                    Jacobsen. <br>
                    The little mermaid is inspired by H. C. Andersen’s fairytale “The Little Mermaid” who is willing to
                    sacrifice everything to be with the prince who lives on the land. Today many kids know about the
                    little mermaid from the disney version.

                <p>Since 1748 The Royal Danish Theater has been located at Kongens Nytorv in Copenhagen. For the first
                    couple of seasons the staff was very modest, it only consisted of 8 actors, 4 actresses, 2 male
                    dancers and 1 female dancer. The first expansion was The Royal Chapel that became the set inhouse
                    orchestra in 1770.
                    <br> <br>
                    Around the year of 1800 the acting staff was doubled, about 30 singers formed the Oprah choir and
                    the number of dancers was ten-doubled.
                    In 1830 August Bournonville became the leader of The Ballet and from then he has been one of the
                    most important figures of The Royal Danish Theater. He was the first professional instructor of the
                    Theater and his job was to build a qualified ballet of about 50 dancers.
                    In the 1960’s the Ballet was going through a big internationalization. The staff was no longer as
                    fixed as before. Many left and new ones joined. One of the things The Royal Danish Theater did to go
                    more international was to bring in more international choreographers, George Balanchine among
                    others.
                    <br> <br>
                    As one of the most important culture institutions it was crucial for The Royal Danish Theater to
                    make its mark at the European Culture City, where ballet especially was a focus point.
                    There was an exceptionally high number of shows in 1996 and they implemented among others Peter
                    Martins new work “Svanesøen” in cooperation with the artist Per Kirkeby. Two years later, in 1998,
                    The Royal Danish Theater, could celebrate their 250-years anniversary, which they did by putting
                    together a big jubilee show to mark the different style arts.
                    In 2008 Nikolaj Hübbe came home from New York to be the new Ballet leader after he had been a solo
                    dancer at the New York City Ballet for 17 years. Nikolaj Hübbe for example renewed some of
                    Bournonvilles biggest works: Sylfiden, Napoli og Et folkesagn. Both the audience and the reporters
                    were enthusiastic.
